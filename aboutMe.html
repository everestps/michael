      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>I am currently a senior at Everest Public High School. I have lived all over the bay area in my life and have been exposed to code and computers
      in various places. I currently live in Silicon Valley where programming is very prevalent and important. I plan to go to college to learn about computer science or another field 
      pertaining to computers.</p>
      <h3>My favorite things.</h3>
      <p>My favorite things include music, soccer, computer programming and spending time hanging out with friends. I have been actively seeking out new music since I was in middle school.
      Music is incredibly important to me and I hope to find a job that can combine computer programming with my love of music. I think that an interesting idea would be to create some type
      of website where users can share their music and discover new artists as large record labels become obsolete.
